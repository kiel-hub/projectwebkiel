            <strong>HOW DO WE BECOME STRATEGIC FOUNDER:</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Well, we have time! We have passion, we have the itch why certain
            today's consumers and businesses problems (hi, there are lots of
            them!) don't get a modern technology and digital solution! Yes,
            there are GoFoods, GrabCars, TokoPedias, DANA, GoPay and the likes
            and they are solving real problems, but it is just scratching the
            surface! So many other things are so cumbersome and impractical. Why
            don't somebody think of an elegant and practical solutions? Then we
            reckon, WHY NOT US? WHY WAIT FOR SOMEBODY ELSE?
          </p>
          <p>
            For SEASONED BABY BOOMERS, waiting for a solution IS AN OPPORTUNITY!
          </p>
          <p>
            We are successful, we have lots of experiences and skills, we have
            business networks and access to industries and expertise. We also
            have some access to Capital.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we meet millennials, we are amazed by their energy and
            creativity, their new way of thinking, their emphasis to
            experiencing life like living in good places or enjoying transport
            rather than bogged down with matters like mortgages or cars. It's so
            refreshing and we baby boomers enjoy experiencing good lifestyle
            too! But we also are sometimes stumped by the millennials lack of
            knowledge of some mundane practical things which we know so well!
            This is also an OPPORTUNITY!
          </p>
          <p>
            We should Partner with the millennials! We can complement each other
            so perfectly! Their digital savvy, energy, speed and courage to make
            decisions complement well with our abundance of experiences,
            practical and measured tech savviness, access to resources as well
            as baby boomers' famous enthusiasm to create something new.
          </p>
          <p>
            So with Baby Boomers analytical experiences, we begin formulating a
            sustainable modular model and structures for incubating a startup by
            breaking down elements crucial for Business StartUp, focusing on the
            collaborative process of VALUE CREATION and shielding the noises
            from finance administration and reporting, cashflows and tax by
            providing a Proxy Shell Company for Business Transactions within the
            18 months incubation prior to eventual entity structuring. We also
            provide leadership and mentoring, financial control and curating the
            quality of business process and model in active collaboration with
            BUSINESS OPERATORS FOUNDER and TECHNOLOGY FOUNDER.
          </p>
          <p>
            As
            <a href="team.html"> STRATEGIC FOUNDER </a>
            we carefully curated a database of VALUE CREATION IDEAS, based upon
            N0RTHERN LIGHTS Principles, along with Business and Financial
            Models, Business Vision, Business Process, Value Proposition.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also will be providing some SEED CAPITAL as well as arranging
            additional SEED CAPITAL from Crowdfunding Sources for the 18 months
            incubation period prior to entity structuring and FIRST ROUND
            INVESTOR(s) entry. For this SEED CAPITAL part contributed by the
            STRATEGIC FOUNDER, the STRATEGIC FOUNDER is also part of the SEED
            CAPITAL PASSIVE FOUNDER and therefore has the exact same eligibility
            and responsibilities (and also the same risks) as the other SEED
            CAPITAL PASSIVE FOUNDER which are not a STRATEGIC FOUNDER.
          </p>
          <p>
            All N0RTHERN LIGHTS Value Creation Project incubation period are set
            to be a maximum of 18 months period, upon which, if no FIRST ROUND
            INVESTOR(s) agrees to invest in the Value Creation Project at a
            reasonable valuation and terms and conditions, then the Value
            Creation Project will be deemed as failed and all activities and
            investments from all the FOUNDERS will stop and ceased completely.

        <div class="kanan-kiri kanan">
          <h3>BUSINESS OPERATORS FOUNDER:</h3>
          <p>
            Will contribute their expertise and time to design the Business
            Processes, manage day-to-day end-to-end Operations of the StartUp,
            handle Staffworks, Administration, Legal Contract Documents signing
            and filing. Main Responsibilities will be setting up Business Plan,
            Target and Achievements, Marketing & Communication of the StartUp
            and Customer/Business Partners facing.
          </p>
          <div class="spacer"></div>
          <h3>TECHNOLOGY FOUNDER:</h3>
          <p>
            Will contribute their technical expertise to design, architect,
            develop/code and implement the user interfaces, technical ecosystems
            for the Mobile Apps, Front End and Back End Systems along with all
            the required interfaces to third party systems as well as interfaces
            to devices used in this value creation and its day to day technical
            systems operations and its security aspects, and therefore will be
            called TECHNOLOGY FOUNDER.
          </p>
          <div class="spacer"></div>
          <h3>SEED CAPITAL PASSIVE FOUNDER:</h3>
          <p>
            Will contribute some small token seed capital for a maximum 18
            months incubation period prior to entity structuring and FIRST ROUND
            INVESTOR(s) entry. The concept would be like those of crowdfunding
            projects, only this seed capital is in a small token units of equity
            rights based upon equal shares proportion as the seed capital from
            the STRATEGIC FOUNDER on apple to apple basis. The SEED CAPITAL
            PASSIVE FOUNDER is for those who believe in the viability of the
            VALUE CREATION PROJECT and wanted to be part of original Founders of
            the StartUp and benefit from the high valuation increase of the
            StartUp but without having to contribute in skills and time or any
            involvement in day to day incubation period. All the collective SEED
            CAPITAL PASSIVE FOUNDER will be eligible through all the seed
            capital combined (including the one coming from STRATEGIC FOUNDER)
            for an equal equity rights shares as the STRATEGIC FOUNDER, BUSINESS
            OPERATORS FOUNDER and TECHNOLOGY FOUNDER once the entity is
            successfully structured. Upon successful entity structuring of a
            maximum of 18 months incubation period, the SEED CAPITAL PASSIVE
            FOUNDER, have an option to either exit their seed capital investment
            at a high return determined by the STRATEGIC FOUNDER at the
            beginning of the Value Creation Project (recognizing the high risk
            nature of a StartUp incubation period) or stay as a passive
            shareholders.
