          <h3>SHAM BHARWANI</h3>
          <p>
            His passion for cutting edge research and technology is coupled with
            a commitment to providing today's millennials with skills and
            opportunity. This drove him together with his co-founders to start
            <strong>N0RTHERN LIGHTS</strong>
            who's open for millennials to be their equal partner. He is a firm
            believer that Millennials who believes in
            <strong>NEW DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY</strong>
            of today as second nature, need to be coupled with
            <strong>TRIED, TESTED AND TRUSTED BUSINESS WISDOM</strong>, a trait
            all FOUNDERS OF N0RTHERN LIGHTS (all
            <strong>SEASONED TECH SAVVY BABY BOOMERS</strong>
            ) posses in order to faster penetrate and redefine current Business
            Practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a personal capacity (he is a veteran in BEDDING TECHNOLOGY and
            Industry), he invented a new spring bed technology, shying away from
            the use of metal spring to avoid corrosion, by using a superior non
            corrosive material as a spring, heavy duty
            <strong>PLASTICS</strong>. Hence the name
            <strong>PLASSPRING</strong>
            BED is introduced to the market. His marketing genius, demoed a real
            truck running on top of the
            <strong>PLASSPRING</strong>
            BED which put an end to speculations that Plastics cannot be as
            strong a spring as a Metal spring.
